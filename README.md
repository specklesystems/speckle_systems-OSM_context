# OSM context

## Get OpenStreetMap context and Basemap for your Revit project

This function reads the location of your Revit model (latitude, longitude and angle to True North) and generates a new 
3d model with OSM buildings and roads within specified radius from the model. It also generates a .PNG image with a basemap 
of your selected location.

### More details
This functon will create a custom Coordinate Reference System based on Traverse Mercator and centered around specified location, 
so that the size distortions of the real-world location are minimized. 3d geometries within specified radius will then be queried from 
[OSM API service](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Overpass_API), and the information for the basemap will be queried from the [OSM raster tiles provider](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Raster_tile_providers). 

Location info from Revit model (lat, lon, angle) will be derived from the following settings under the tab Manage->Location:
